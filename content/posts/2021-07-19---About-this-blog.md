I've long avoided creating a personal website, let alone a blog. I think I always viewed it as unnecessary for myself, and that I didn't have anything important to say. But I've since realized that I enjoy talking about things I find interesting, and it's ok if I write it down no one even reads it. The act of writing helps to evolve my ideas and helps me learn.

## So why blog?

I've decided that its ok that the purpose of this blog is going to be mostly self-indulgent; I don't get to do much writing anymore, so this is a way to do so. I'm not going to promise that by reading this your worldview will be altered for the better, or you'll learn some shiny new work-related things. Basically, I'd just like to have a place where I can write some thoughts down and potentially have a discussion with anyone who happens to see it.

Writing can be a joyless activity when it's imposed by the powers that be (I hated writing papers in high school). In college, majoring in engineering, I was required to do very little writing, and the writing I did do (mostly lab reports, etc.) was incredibly boring to me. Post college, I've found that when I _choose_ to write, and I'm allowed to do it in my voice rather than the robot voice required by the college of engineering, I actually enjoy it. While I don't expect anyone else to read this, if anyone in the black hole to which I am sending these posts called the internet ends up reading and enjoying them, I'll consider that an unexpected yet welcome outcome. I've found that the best way for me to evaluate and evolve my own thinking is to write it down, so if nothing else, I hope only to accomplish this.

## A note on style

Because this is mainly for myself, I'm going to write how I like to write, which is how I talk. In my experience, people find it easier to read things that are written in the way they're most familiar with. So if you don't like run-on sentences, comma splicing, and informal language then this is not the place for you. If you don't like attempts at humor while discussing serious topics, then this is not the place for you. If you like to take a lighthearted approach to learning something new and questioning the way that you view the world, then you've come to the right place.

## Topics I'll write about

I sort of pride myself on having an extremely broad yet probably shallow range of knowledge. I have the most fun when I'm learning about a topic that I know little about, but when I reach a minimum level of competency on that topic, I usually abandon learning anything else about it, but I rarely forget what I initially learned. Because of my love of extremely varied topics, expect these blog posts to touch on a wide range of subjects going into a small amount of depth in each post. My goal with this approach is threefold: 1. alienate any possibility of a regularly interested base of readers by ensuring that they can never come back to read more on a specific topic, 2. anger everyone that knows more about the topic than I do; since this is the internet, that is guaranteed to happen and 3. more seriously, potentially introduce others to an idea or topic that they've never encountered, and at best change the way they think about the world.

## See you soon

So with that said, I will hopefully set aside time to write in the near future. I look forward to writing about things I care about and getting to talk to new people! If you want to connect, please don't hesitate to reach out!
