![A picture of me.](/photo.jpg)

Currently I'm a software engineer at [NexHealth](nexhealth.com). The purpose of this blog is going to give me a creative outlet since I don't get to do much writing anymore (read more [here](/posts/about-this-blog)). If anyone else finds it interesting, or it helps me connect with people, I'll consider that an unexpected yet welcome outcome.

If you want to talk about software engineering, statistics, reading, writing, music, coffee, or just about anything, don't hesitate to [reach out](/pages/contacts).

You can take a look at some of the things I've been doing recently here:
